## Schedule and plan

* Github workflow and the final project.

### More on modules, with some practice

Notes:

* [on_modules](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/on_modules).
* [Four dimensions
  exercise](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nipraxis/summer-2023/main?urlpath=tree/four_dimensions/four_dimensions.ipynb)

```
git clone https://github.com/nipraxis/first_module
cd first_module
python3 -m IPython
```

then (in IPython):

```
run spm_funcs.py
```

On debugging.

### On the benefits of searching for the right solution

We discussed the phenomenon that scientific programmers often stall at
a certain level, and do not continue learning.

The key to learning is *deliberative practice*, as [Peter
Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) discusses in his page
[Teach Yourself Programming in 10 years](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html).

On the other hand, being good at programming *quickly* has some costs. [Peter
Norvig notes that Google employees do slightly less well if they have
previously won a programming
competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmyUZCl75s), and speculates this
is because the best programmers think hard and for a long time about the right
solution.  We recommend this course to you, of taking time to reflect on the
right way to solve each problem.
