## Homework

Make sure you've done the exercises from the sessions:

* Session 1:
  * [Camera](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nipraxis/summer-2023/main?urlpath=tree/camera/camera.ipynb)
* Session 2:
    * [Anatomical
    exercise](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nipraxis/summer-2023/main?urlpath=tree/anatomical/anatomical.ipynb)
    * Consider also: [Arteries
    exercise](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nipraxis/summer-2023/main?urlpath=tree/arteries/arteries.ipynb)

In the next session, we will be starting with Git, and to work on your own
computer.

Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the [curious
git](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/) tutorial.

We think this will take you 90 minutes, at a careful read, and you will need
to read it carefully, in order to benefit from it.

If you do read it carefully, you will be investing in your own future
productivity â€” Git version control is a powerful way to work more efficiently,
especially in collaboration, and you need to understand the way that Git
**thinks**, in order to use Git with fluency and efficiency.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
