# Some Google Python course exercises

These exercises are from <https://developers.google.com/edu/python>.  See the
file `./LICENCE.txt`, but, if you are busy, the files have an Apache 2.0
license.

The files here differ from the originals in that we (the Nipraxis team) have updated the files to run with Python 3, converted them to Jupyter Notebooks, and put the relevant tests next to the code cells for clarity.
