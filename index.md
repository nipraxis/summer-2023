## About the course

See [the main course page](https://nipraxis.org) for an overall
description of the course, including the requirements, and a rough
schedule of classes.

## About this iteration

This is the first full version of the course.  We have already run a
pilot version of the course, and we have taught versions of this
course previously in Berkeley â€” see [the about page](about#resources).

## When will it be?

The Summer course will run for 8 weeks from the week starting 31th July 2023, through to the week starting September 18th 2023.

## How much does it cost?

The course is completely free.

## How much time will it take?

We ask you to commit yourself to:

* 8 weeks, from the 31 July through 22 September 2023.
* 1 hour per week of independent study, either reading or videos.
* Two 2 hour live sessions on Zoom
* 1-2 hours per week of homework / group work.

That's 6-7 hours per week for 8 weeks.

## Prerequisites

For the upcoming version of the Nipraxis course, we will assume that you *have
a reasonable working knowledge of Python and the Numpy array library for
Python*.  We will start from that basis at the beginning of the course.

In particular, we will expect you to know about:

* Using Numpy arrays.
* [for loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop).
* Writing your own functions on Python.

You will find the course easier if you have done some brain imaging analysis
before, but that is not a requirement.

## How do I join?

See below for more detail - but please apply to join by [filling in
the form](https://forms.gle/fz2E6q6HvqnyCmSp9).

We would like you to join in groups of around 3.  We believe this will help
your learning and engagement with the course; you will learn a lot from each
other, as well as from the course.

So, if you can, find your group before you fill in the form, and fill the form
in, on behalf of your group.  If you can't find a group, don't worry too much,
we will try and find you a group to work with.

If you have any questions, or you have any problems forming a group, please
contact one of the instructors by email - see the [staff page](staff).
