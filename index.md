## About the course

See [the main course page](https://nipraxis.org) for an overall
description of the course, including the requirements.

See [the actual schedule](schedule.md) for a list of sessions and subjects.

## About this iteration

This is the first full version of the course.  We have already run a
pilot version of the course, and we have taught versions of this
course previously in Berkeley — see [the about page](about#resources).

## When was it?

The Summer course ran for 8 weeks from the week starting 31th July 2023,
through to the week starting September 18th 2023.

## How much did it cost?

The course is completely free.

## How much time did it take?

We asked you to commit yourself to:

* 8 weeks, from the 31 July through 22 September 2023.
* 1 hour per week of independent study, either reading or videos.
* Two 2 hour live sessions on Zoom
* 1-2 hours per week of homework / group work.

That's 6-7 hours per week for 8 weeks.

The last four weeks of homework and extra work are for a final group project.
This is a group collaborative project working on a substantial and novel data
analysis problem. We will give more details during the course.

## Prerequisites

For the upcoming version of the Nipraxis course, we will assume that you *have
a reasonable working knowledge of Python and the Numpy array library for
Python*.  We will start from that basis at the beginning of the course.

In particular, we will expect you to know about:

* Using Numpy arrays.
* [for loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop).
* Writing your own functions on Python.

You will find the course easier if you have done some brain imaging analysis
before, but that is not a requirement.

## How would I have joined?

See below for more detail - students applied to join by filling in the a Google
form.

We like you to join in groups of around 3.  We believe this will help your
learning and engagement with the course; you will learn a lot from each other,
as well as from the course.

So, if you can, find your group before you fill in the form, and fill the form
in, on behalf of your group.  If you can't find a group, don't worry too much,
we will try and find you a group to work with.

If you have any questions, or you have any problems forming a group, please
contact one of the instructors by email - see the [staff page](staff).

## Certificate and credit

We will send you a certificate of completion, when you finish the course, and
the assignments.  In particular, you will need to finish the final project, to
get a certificate.

If you want credit for this course with your institution, feel free to put your
administration in touch with us — we will try to arrange that, if practical.
